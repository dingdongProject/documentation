\begin{abstract}
Circles are essential activities for university students. In Korea, about 80\% of university students participate in circles. Also, There are many students who participate in more than 1 social activities. For these students, managing circle schedule and keeping track of necessary information of dozen circles is not easy. Ding Dong is a mobile application for circle members. It helps users manage circle activities and to be in touch with other members more easily.

\section{Introduction}
This document is about our project Ding Dong. It explains how we came up with the idea, functions of the app and how we progress to develop our final outcome.

\subsection{Motivation}
Our motivation began with the problem that team members actually suffer from. All three members of the team are participating in several circles. We found it very inefficient how the circles use group chats or alternative social services such as `Facebook', or collaborative tools such as `Slack' and `Discord' to share schedule and notifications. because these services are not made for circle management, there exists several inconvenience. Especially when a person participate in more than one circle. Keeping track of notifications becomes more complicated because the information you need is not well organized. Thus, we came up with the idea of a mobile app that allows circles to organize and handle notices and schedules.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Circle members suffer from following notification and circle schedules using unorganized, decentralized group chats or group pages. Also for circle executives, it is hard to manage the members efficiently. For instance, it is difficult to check who have read the notices, and whether the member is active member or not. Thus we decided to develop a mobile app focused on providing these functions necessary for circle activities.

\subsection{Related Software}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Band: `Band' is an app for groups, including circles. It provides useful services for group members and leaders to use. However, band is more about communicating between band members freely rather than managing notices and schedules. It provides functions such as boards, chatting, gallery, calendar, member contacts and finding alumni.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Distinctions: Band is operated by Naver, the biggest portal site in Korea. Thus, it is easier for users to approach. Also it provides both mobile and PC software.
        \item Weakness: Band aims for open-community. Thus, group page is exposed to everyone and anyone can join a group and post new articles.
    \end{enumerate}

        \caption{Naver Band}
        \label{fig:my_label}
    \end{figure}
    \item Discord: `Discord' is VoIP, instant messaging and digital distribution platform designed for creating communities. Its main functions are voice and video chats. Discord is mainly used by gamer, to communicate with friends while playing games together. However, It is also widely used by circles to create communities and communicate. 
     \begin{enumerate}
        \item Distinctions: Its strength are real-time chats. They support voice, video chats and screen-sharing functions. Other strength are its simple design, easy-to-use UI and UX.
        \item Weakness: Its main focus is to provide on game related services. Thus, it might not be appropriate for managing circles.
    \end{enumerate}
     \begin{figure}[h]

        \includegraphics[width=4cm]{images/discord.jpeg}
        \caption{Discord}
        \label{fig:my_label}
    \end{figure}
     
    \item Slack: `Slack' is a business communication platform. `Slack' offers many IRC-style features, including persistent chat rooms (channels) organized by topic, private groups, and direct messaging.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Distinctions: It can be linked to Github, Redmine and provide useful functions for programmers. Also chat rooms(channels) are easy way to divide chat rooms by topics.
        \item Weakness: Its focus is on business communication, so it might not be appropriate for circle management. Also, the UI/UX is not very easy to use for first-timers.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Our Distinctions}
While these related softwares can be used for circle management, they are not 100\% suitable for it. Dingdong will focus on providing easier way for managing circles, and communication services between the members of circles.

\end{enumerate}
\section{Development Environment}
\subsection{Development Environment and programming languages}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item React-Native 0.63.3: for development of Android and iOS application.
    \item Python 3.7.4: for development of web server.
    \item Django 3.1.1: Django is the most popular python web framework that allows rapid development of web services. We will use Django for development of our backend server.
    \item Django-Rest Framework 3.12.1: Django-Rest framework is a framework that helps making the django server RESTful. Since we will be using our django server as a backend server for mobile application, we will need to make our server RESTful.
    \item MySQL: Database management.
    \item AWS Lightsail: Lightsail is an easy-to-use cloud platform that offers everything needed to build an application or website, plus a cost-effective, monthly plan. 
    \item AWS S3: AWS S3 is a storage service. We will use S3 to store images that the users upload.
    \item Linux(Ubuntu Server 18.04): We will use Ubutu Server 18.04 on our EC2 instance to deploy our server.
\end{enumerate} 
\subsection{Cost Estimation}
The cost will mostly come from using AWS services. Lightsail cost is fixed to \$3.5 per month. S3 costs will vary based on number of requests made. We estimate the cost to be around \$10 per month.
\subsection{Software in Use}
We made use of open sources to build our app. Especially for React-Native, there are many third-party libraries that we can use, such as react-native-navigation.   
\subsection{Task distribution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Kyung Rok An: Front-end developer. He is in charge of development of our mobile app using react-native.
    \item Chang Hui, Yun: Back-end developer. He is in charge of development of our Django based server.
    \item Jun Seub, Lim: He is in charge of deployment and management of the service.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Specification}
\subsection{Onboarding} Few pages with image and text that explains about our service and how to use. Will only be displayed the first time user opens the app.

\subsection{Sign up and Log In}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Signing up : Enter â€˜usernameâ€™, â€˜emailâ€™, â€˜passwordâ€™, and â€˜password againâ€™ in the Text input box. If the format is not correct, the alert window appears when the Sign up button is pressed and all text input boxes are initialized. The format of username and password is specified below the Text input box. The ID must contain letters and numbers of 4 to 30 characters, and the password must contain letters and numbers of 8 to 16 characters. Email address must follow the email form. If the password entered in â€˜password againâ€™ and string do not match, an alert window appears. If sing up is successful, the server generates user information such as tokens and navigate back to login page.
    \item Log in : Enter 'username' and 'password' and press the log in button to immediately check the user information on the server and navigate to the main home if it matches the user information.
    \item Logout : Click the Logout button and the 'alert' window appears, and if user agree to log out, clear the user's token from the Async Storage and the server.
    \item Password Reset : When entering a user email, a link to the password reset website is sent to the email.

\section{Overall Architecture}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/AWS.png}
    \caption{Overall Architecture}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}
Figure4 explains our overall Architecture. On AWS, we used lighsail and s3. Lightsail is an easy-to-use cloud platform that offers useful services needed to build an application at very reasonable price. It was much easier to set up and use then ec2, which is the widely used service for computing. S3 was used for storing image files. User profile pictures, circle pictures are stored in the s3 bucket.
\subsection{Front-End Architecture}
For the front-end side, we used React-Native as our framework. So, the architecture of our app follows that of the React-Native. React-Native has components, which are separate items representing each views. Each components can be wrapped by or wrap other components, forming parent-child relationship. In Dingdong's front-end, the most-upper Component is App.tsx, wrapping other components inside it.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item One important aspect is Context. Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. In other words, context is global variable that can be used all over the components, without having to be passed down from parent components.
    In our project, we used two Contexts. User and Circle. User context includes data about the user, including the username, circles he is involved in, and etc. Circle includes data for showing circle pages, such as bulletin board, posts and etc. These two data should be available in all components and thus are managed by context. In the figure below, the boxes that starts with 'I' represent interfaces. They define abstract design of the data. The contexts are User and Circle, which implements these interfaces in the data inside them. They also have functions inside which can be used to set the data.

    \item The navigation architecture is as followed. First there is Tab Bar which can be used to navigate following screens: Home, Schedule, Circles, MyPage. In Home screen, there is a drawer, which allows navigation to each circle page, circle creation page, circle join page and if there are any new invitations to the circle that you are admin of, there will also be a button which navigate to respond screen. In each screens, there is stack navigation, which is a navigation that stacks new screens on top of the previous one. This is the most basic and widely used screen navigation in mobile apps. Figure 10 explains the whole navigation and a brief explanation of the screens used in our app.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Back-End Architecture}
For the back-end side, we follow the basic structure of Django framework. However, we also implemented django-restframework, which is slightly different to original django. In our back-end, we have 4 main components. models.py, serializers.py, urls.py, and views.py. Models.py is where we define models, the database structure that we use in the project. This is where we define users, circles, membership and etc. Each class members inside these model classes represent fields. These model classes are converted in to database tables by django. Serializers allow complex data such as querysets and model instances to be converted to native Python datatypes that can then be easily rendered into JSON, XML or other content types. These serializer classes are defined in serializers.py file. In urls.py, we defined urls paths which dispatches views for each paths. In views.py we defined each views for requests to the url paths we defined earlier.

\subsection{Database Structure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User: The User table contains user data. We inherited Django's default user model to created our own model because we needed our users to have their own profile pictures.
    \item Circle:  Circle table contains data about circles. Each entry has name, explanation, unique code and picture.
    \item Membership: Membership table connects users and circles. It defines the membership status of user to a circle. Each entry explains whether the user is admin, is active and the date of join.
    \item Tag: Tag table contains tags that explains the circle. For instance, 'sports' is a type of tag that explains circles which are related o sports.
    \item CircleTag: CircleTag connects circles and tags.
    \item Board: Board table contains data of boards. The circle the board is in, name of the board and whether members are allowed to write to a board.
    \item Post: Post table contains data of each posts. The title, content, the board it is in, and the owner of the post.
    \item Comment: Comment table contains data of comments to a post.
    \item PostImage: PostImages contains data of pictures for posts. 
    \item Read: Read table contains whether the user has read the post of not.
    \item Schedule: Schedule table contains schedule data for circles.
    \item Request: Request table contains requests to join a circle. These requests are shown to the admins of a circle and they can process these requests either by accepting it or declining it.

\subsection{Front End Structure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Main Dir: App.tsx is a typescript file which is the main file that will be executed at the very first time.
    \item Api Dir: This is where we keep api functions that we need in the app to communicate with the server. Config.js file is where the api base address and base functions for sending http request are located. Api.js file is where we keep all functions that we use in the app.
    \item Asset Dir: Asset directory keeps all static files. For now, only images are the files that we need. These images include all icons used in the app , splash screen image and so on.
    \item Component Dir: This is where we keep all the components that we use in the app. They are reusable components which are continuously used in the app. For instance, Input components are reused in many screens where inputs from user are needed.
    \item Constant Dir: This is where we keep the constants that we need. Most of the constants are related to the design, such as RGB code for the colors that we use in the app. Managing them as constants help to change the color at once and keep unity. For instance, we keep the RGB code for our main color, which is \#5F89FA. When we need to change the color, we can simply change it here instead of changing in every file that we used this color.
    \item Context Dir: This is where we keep the Context data. In React (and React Native), Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. Thus, we keep the important and diversely used data in Context. These data are the circle information and the user information. Each of these files also has methods to set these data.
    \item Screen Dir: This is where we keep the Screens. Screens are views that will be displayed on the app. Each screen file has its class and rendering functions to display views.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Back End Structure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Main directory: Main directory. manage.py is the file that help to manage the project. db.sqlite3 is the database and aws.py is where we keep the aws file passwords.
    \item Setting directory: This is where we settings for the project. base.py has the base class settings that we need. local.py and prod.py inherit the base class and have different settings for local server and production server.
